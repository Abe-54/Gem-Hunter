## Gem Hunter
This is a short platformer, where the player is an adventurer, exploring a cave to find gems. The game was built within the [Unity](https://unity.com/) over the course of a month. 

## Motivation
I decided to make this game because I had an idea and I wanted to explore it. I also wanted to further improve my game development skills, which include programming, artwork, UI, level design, and much more.
